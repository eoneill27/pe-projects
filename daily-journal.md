#Emily's Daily Journal

##October 5, 2022

###Standup
Yesterday I configured my iTerm, got it to open directly in my pe-projects directory, and also set it up to be able to open files in Sublime Text, which I think is really cool. I also changed some settings in Sublime Text and installed Emmet. 

One thing I'm confused about in Sublime - what is the difference between having "Indent using spaces" selected and not having it selected? If you hit tab either way, the cursor indents whatever number of spaces you have set the tab width at - right? I don't think I see a difference in how the text editor behaves when this setting is selected or unselected, but I am certain I am missing something! 

I'm enjoying the HTML reinforcements and practice. I see that we're heading in a slightly different direction today, but it's all related to the overarching goal of creating a personal business card website. 

A blocker yesterday was looking at the Milestones page and feeling a little overwhelmed. I know that we're not necessarily expected to get through everything on the Milestones page every day, but I want to - I have to accept that it's not always going to be possible, but it is going to be there for me to return to when I have time.

###Today's lesson - Networking
I get a little nervous when it comes to networking. I think it's due to some imposter syndrome. Really putting myself out there and having confidence in this thing that I've barely begun makes me feel uncomfortable. I also haven't told anyone at work that I'm doing this - I need to get on that, pronto. It's real, it's what I want, so I need to own it even though it is a little hard.

###To-dos
[x] create Substack account
[x] write an article and publish it (30 minute limit)
[x] network flow chart in Whimsical

###Standup
Yesterday I learned about some different file types. I hadn't realized that SVG files took up so little space relative to JPEG and PNG files - that's pretty awesome. Also, really neat that the code can be modified so easily after the fact - I'm looking forward to learning how to do that.

I also learned that Macs with M1 and M2 chips restart the PRAM by default when you shut down the computer and turn it back on. 

HTML was a bit of a review for me yesterday, but I had fun doing the exercise - I like HTML.

And I set up a git repository in my pe-projects folder and got my daily journal going.

More HTML today! I'd like to poke around MDN a bit - I've dipped in before, but only for really specific questions and I'd like to get a better overview of the site.

No blockers!

###Questions
- how do I change preferences/settings in Sublime? Specifically, how do I make the tab size stick? (note - I watched Derek's video and figured it out)
- what is the difference between "indent using spaces" and "indent using tab?"

###To-Dos
[x] review HTML doc structure
[x] create 4-page website
[] browsing with a keyboard challenge
[] check out MDN

Started on HTML today. It's a review for me, but fun to do, fun to be working on a bit of code. 
- <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>

I watched the video about the problems with VSCode [The Biggest Threat to Innovation of Our Time] (https://youtu.be/mjY5qND8c7U) and wrote this down - "A fair market ensures that innovation takes place." When a giant corporation makes something free, they are not doing it out of a charitable impulse, and they are making sure that they've cornered the market. Of course, we still use Gmail, Google Fonts, and Github. But I thought the point made in the video was a good one, and it definitely makes me think twice about blindly choosing the free option.

File types - the extension tells the parser or the program opening the file which rules to follow
- JPEG, PNG
- SVG
- plain text 
- Rich Text (RTF)
- HTML

UTF-8 - widely accepted, make sure your code works everywhere. 

Looking forward to getting the license for Affinity Designer!

Git seems to be working for me. I'll commit this to a new repository that I've created on my Desktop - I'll have to check in to see if I should be saving this journal somewhere else.
