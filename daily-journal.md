# Emily's Daily Journal

## October 6, 2022

### Standup

Yesterday I practiced using Git to open my daily journal and made sure my repository was still working the way I think it should. I had a little snafu with my course folder - I've been saving everything but pe-projects in a DFTW folder on my desktop, which I thought was actually a Google Drive alias file. In fact, I had a different folder called DFTW on Google Drive, which had different content than the other one. I got the two merged and now I have a Drive alias folder on my desktop for course notes and miscellany. I'm glad I caught it when I did.

I've really enjoyed reading everyone's Substack posts. A huge part of why I wanted to join PE was because I read every Substack post from current and past students that I could get my hands on, and I found them really interesting and inspiring. Now that's us! I'm sure we'll be part of some future student's research and preparation somewhere down the line.

No blockers today. 

### Today's lesson - Research & Web Portals

Get used to leaving your ego out of it and following the requirements as a first priority.

WWW Virtual Library - the oldest catalogue of the web

target can be set to a unique name - 
target="food" would open link in new tab called "food"
I HAD NO IDEA!

*note - I tried this out and found that the name of the tab remained whatever the title of the website is - but it did result in all links with the same target opening in the same tab. This seriously cuts down on the number of open tabs I end up with, so that's really cool!* 

Watch *Halt and Catch Fire* 

Jake recommended Glow for terminal - to view .md files

Alina recommended The Jealous Curator

### To-dos

[x] research 40 minutes. Find great websites & put them into groups.
[x] write about your research process for 10 minutes.
[x] research business card websites. Find 5 examples
[x] create Google Doc for those - take screenshots of each. Write down what you think the goals of the site are and how successful they are.
[x] build web portal
[x] set web portal to be home page

### Questions

Am I doing the right thing by using a User Profile that does not have admin privileges?

Yesterday I configured my iTerm, got it to open directly in my pe-projects directory, and also set it up to be able to open files in Sublime Text, which I think is really cool. I also changed some settings in Sublime Text and installed Emmet. 

One thing I'm confused about in Sublime - what is the difference between having "Indent using spaces" selected and not having it selected? If you hit tab either way, the cursor indents whatever number of spaces you have set the tab width at - right? I don't think I see a difference in how the text editor behaves when this setting is selected or unselected, but I am certain I am missing something! 

I'm enjoying the HTML reinforcements and practice. I see that we're heading in a slightly different direction today, but it's all related to the overarching goal of creating a personal business card website. 

A blocker yesterday was looking at the Milestones page and feeling a little overwhelmed. I know that we're not necessarily expected to get through everything on the Milestones page every day, but I want to - I have to accept that it's not always going to be possible, but it is going to be there for me to return to when I have time.

### Today's lesson - Networking

I get a little nervous when it comes to networking. I think it's due to some imposter syndrome. Really putting myself out there and having confidence in this thing that I've barely begun makes me feel uncomfortable. I also haven't told anyone at work that I'm doing this - I need to get on that, pronto. It's real, it's what I want, so I need to own it even though it is a little hard.

### To-dos

[x] create Substack account
[x] write an article and publish it (30 minute limit)
[x] network flow chart in Whimsical

Yesterday I learned about some different file types. I hadn't realized that SVG files took up so little space relative to JPEG and PNG files - that's pretty awesome. Also, really neat that the code can be modified so easily after the fact - I'm looking forward to learning how to do that.

I also learned that Macs with M1 and M2 chips restart the PRAM by default when you shut down the computer and turn it back on. 

HTML was a bit of a review for me yesterday, but I had fun doing the exercise - I like HTML.

And I set up a git repository in my pe-projects folder and got my daily journal going.

More HTML today! I'd like to poke around MDN a bit - I've dipped in before, but only for really specific questions and I'd like to get a better overview of the site.

No blockers!

### Questions

- how do I change preferences/settings in Sublime? Specifically, how do I make the tab size stick? (note - I watched Derek's video and figured it out)
- what is the difference between "indent using spaces" and "indent using tab?"

### To-Dos

[x] review HTML doc structure
[x] create 4-page website
[] browsing with a keyboard challenge
[] check out MDN

Started on HTML today. It's a review for me, but fun to do, fun to be working on a bit of code. 
- <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>

I watched the video about the problems with VSCode [The Biggest Threat to Innovation of Our Time] (https://youtu.be/mjY5qND8c7U) and wrote this down - "A fair market ensures that innovation takes place." When a giant corporation makes something free, they are not doing it out of a charitable impulse, and they are making sure that they've cornered the market. Of course, we still use Gmail, Google Fonts, and Github. But I thought the point made in the video was a good one, and it definitely makes me think twice about blindly choosing the free option.

File types - the extension tells the parser or the program opening the file which rules to follow
- JPEG, PNG
- SVG
- plain text 
- Rich Text (RTF)
- HTML

UTF-8 - widely accepted, make sure your code works everywhere. 

Looking forward to getting the license for Affinity Designer!

Git seems to be working for me. I'll commit this to a new repository that I've created on my Desktop - I'll have to check in to see if I should be saving this journal somewhere else.
