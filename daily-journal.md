# Emily's Daily Journal

## October 17, 2022

### Standup

Yesterday I took a break from school. I actually got on another plane and flew to Monterey, California for a conference - I'll be here until Thursday. It's the Internet Librarian Conference - I'm going to be really interested to find out what I make of the sessions when I'm looking at them through my new web designer lens. 

I enjoyed Saturday's challenge - even though my site needs a bunch of work, it still felt really good to be able to build something cohesive and relatively complete in such a short period of time. I loved seeing everyone else's sites - I think we all did a really good job. 

I see that there is a pen theme in today's lesson, and I love pens so I'm here for it. I've taken a quick look at the Bezier Game - I'm on the car and it's really hard! But I like the challenge. I definitely need to watch some more tutorials to understand what's going on with the pen tool.

No blockers today.

### Today's lesson - 036: Pen tool & Code Pen


### To-Dos

- [x] make something with the pen tool
- [x] make a Pen showing an image in some text
- [x] make a Pen that uses the 'float' property
- [x] create your first day of 30 graphics

Yesterday I updated the sites I had already styled with inline styles (portal & 4-page website) - removed the inline styles and included a CSS style sheet in the <head>. I think I've got my head wrapped around file structure, FTP, and html. I have a couple of git questions that I'll ask Derek today - mostly around the idea of meaningful commits and timing in the context of this course. I'll report back! 

Yesterday I also started sketching out today's challenge. Is this meant to be the true start of our personal portfolio page? That's how I'm approaching it at the moment.

Today I'm looking forward to really digging into the challenge. I think the key for me will be to not get too wrapped up in spending a lot of time styling at the outset - get the fundamentals in there, add some basic styling, and then do more if time allows. I'm sure this is a project that I'll continue to update in the coming weeks.

### Today's lesson - 034: CSS challenge

No lesson per se - just the challenge! Combine everything you've learned so far into one project.

### To-dos

- [x] challenge-1
- [x] ask Derek some git questions

Yesterday I had fun playing with gradients and I spent some time attempting a Big Sur recreation. My first try was really rough, my second was a bit better. It needs some major work! And I had to go to bed before I figured out how to blur the edges of my layers, but I did get some practice with the selection brush tool. I added my 2 attempts to the 032 channel. I'd be very curious to know what tools and techniques other people use to approach this. I will keep working on it!

I've decided to try to make a point of going to the library once a week to flip through some magazines and make that part of my visual inspiration collection habits. 

Today I need to get to the Goals milestone. It's been on my mind but it keeps getting pushed aside in favor of the lessons and exercises and now noodling around with Affinity. 

No blockers today!


### Today's lesson - 033: CSS intro

CSS is a declarative programming language. Allows us to write the CSS rules and "strongly suggest" how our content is presented visually.

Fundamentally - key:value pairs

CSS is how you separate your content from its presentation. 
selector - property:value = style declaration

font-size - should be at least 16px

line-height - relative to font size - no units - 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc.

letter-spacing - ems - also relative to font size - 0.03 em, for ex. - sets distance between characters, not just letters

max-width: 960px for body is pretty typical

horizontally center an element by setting margin-right and margin-left to auto

can set max-width on individual elements - can set a limit on how many characters are in a line - 82ch for P, for ex. 

ch unit relative to font size and to the size of a zero

Remember that display: block elements are naturally 100% of the width of their parent element. Setting a max-width gives you some control

### To-dos

- [x] goals
- [x] strip out inline style attributes in HTML & replace with CSS in head
- [x] double check file structure, HTML, FTP, and metadata understanding
- [] get together with the group

### Standup

Yesterday we got our hands on Affinity Designer. I didn't have any time to test it out until after work, and I have a swim bootcamp at 8pm on Wednesdays (this is the one scheduled extracurricular activity that I haven't quit in favor of PE), so I was militant about my use of the timeboxing guidelines for the exercises. This sort of program is almost totally new to me - apart from the much smaller toolboxes in programs like CleanShot and Paint, the only thing that comes close is Photo Shop - and I haven't used that since 2001. I'm looking forward to getting more comfortable with the Affinity tools and different modes, and just understanding what all of the terminology means.

I was worried that I would open the program up and not be able to think of anything to create, but I just took a stream of consciousness approach, tested out different tools and played with the colors, and ended up making a few things that I wouldn't have thought to plan out on paper beforehand. I liked how one thing kind of led to another and how it's so easy to manipulate each layer - so if you're not happy with one element you can just change it or toss it and start again without pitching the entire thing.

Today I have no plans after work, so I feel better about how the lesson and exercises are going to fit in today. I'm looking forward to spending more time in Affinity! 

### Today's lesson - 032: Gradients

In Affinity, use fill tool to click and drag to make a gradient. Click G as a shortcut. Hold shift while dragging it to lock at a 90 degree angle. Click on the circles at the end of the fill tool line to change the fill color.

PNG vs. JPEG - when there are lots of tiny dots of color, JPEG will be smaller.

Design is just a thought process.
Be a designer, not just a coder.
 
### To-dos

- [] goals
- [x] visual inspiration
- [x] make some gradients
- [x] revisit your project ideas
- [x] bonus - try to recreate the Big Sur desktop background

### Standup

Yesterday was a lot of time spent digging into source code, learning about rich metadata, and working on my file structure. I added a "projects" folder to my root "pe-projects folder," which meant I had to update all of my website links, but I think I have that sorted out now. 

With peprojects.dev and the file structure - I'm wondering if we are supposed to transfer everything in "pe-projects" (or whatever we end up calling the root folder) to the server - or just the "projects" folder and the index? Does the journal need to be in there, or the "goals" folder? Also curious about the "images" folder. Will we have separate "images" folders in each project folder, as well? 

Looks like we're getting into Affinity Designer today! I have essentially zero experience with programs like this, so I am nervous and excited. No blockers!

### Today's lesson - 031: Affinity

Digital assets

HTML meta - charset, viewport, name=description content="..."

Open Graph meta data - meta tags for social media sharing graphics

Meta descriptions - Google generally truncates these to 155-160 characters. There is no technical limit.

Test updated site with Facebook Debugger, Twitter Card Validator, Linked Ins Post Inspector, www.opengraph.xyz 

Standard-ish meta image size = 1200 x 630 px
72 DPI
It's for the web, so it's RGB
can't use SVG for Open Graph

### To-dos

- [] VISUAL INSPIRATION!
- [x] Affinity - create 1 of each type of image: JPG, PNG, SVG (40 mins) 
- [x] Affinity - create a metadata share image (20 mins) 
- [x] add new site meta & image [30 mins, don't overthink]

Yesterday was a good day of getting things organized and feeling comfortable in where I'm at in the class. I got a start with Tower for Git, which is a much more user-friendly interface than the command line. I want to keep practicing with the command line to commit files just so I don't forget how to do it, but Tower makes things really simple. They have a good resource on their website for total git newbies, which we obviously are not but it's still helpful to take a look at it! Lots of other useful learning materials on there too.

I definitely need to work on prioritizing my visual inspiration folder. Having this task as a constant in the back of my brain is a new habit that I need to develop. I'm going to try to make a point today of taking some screenshots and building that muscle memory.

No blockers today, go Mariners!

### Today's lesson - 030: viewing source, site metadata, intro to Dev Tools

A web crawler is a software application/bot that runs automated tasks to download webpages for the purpose of recording their content and how they are connected. A search engine can then search that evolving set of data. 

CMD + OPT + i to open Chrome Dev tools.

It is very hard and expensive to fix a huge mess once it's made - much easier to just do things well in the first place

Thoughtful metadata in your html means services like social media and text messaging applications can display a richer set of information for the viewer.

### First group meeting 

We had our first group meeting at noon - me, Jake, Drew, Alina, Jess and eventually Derek. I don't think we talked about much that was course-related, but it was really nice to chat with everyone! 

### Stuff I need to continue to work on

html practice - get your websites doing what you want them to do. 
- [] I need to figure out spacing and responsiveness. 
- [] Why are the dots above your 4-pager nav bar going off the page? Do they do this in every browser?
- [] responsive nav bar
- [] add some divs? or sections? Don't want the text to stretch all the way across the page if the screen is big. 
- [] file structure?

### To-dos 

- [] visual inspiration
- [x] rich metadata exploration
- [x] Lighthouse experiments
- [x] looking at other people's code
- [x] working on file structure

Today is Canadian Thanksgiving here and also Indigenous Peoples' Day in the US. I've been streaming KEXP radio and their morning show is playing a pretty great Indigenous Peoples' Day program right now. You can check it out at kexp.org.

I thought I would do some work yesterday, but I pretty much took the day off and that was good. On Saturday, I got Cyberduck set up and moved my project files over to the PE Projects server. I think it all went pretty smoothly for me. 

Today I'm glad we have what seems to be kind of a catch up day. Apart from the exercises, I want to take a look at Divvy and get that going. My windows tend to not be well-arranged and it will be nice to have a way to manage that. I also want to collect some helpful design-related links in my portal, like the Sorted CSS Colors and Safe Web Fonts pages - I'd like to to have resources like that all in one place. 

No blockers!

### Today's lesson - 029: Being accountable for breaking more things more often

Rubber duck debugging - a method of debugging code by articulating a problem in spoken or written natural language. Teaching someone or explaining to someone who knows nothign about programming forces evaluation of the problem from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding. Explaining to an inanimate object is fine!

If you run into a problem - go back to the last bit you are sure of. Start there and write out each of the steps/thoughts until you get to the point where you are stuck. Say it out loud as you write and think. Sometimes you'll answer your own question. If not, you'll have a clear thought process outlined so when someone else is ready to help  you, the context is clear.

Pair programming - 2 programmers work together at one workstation. 1 driver writes the code, 1 navigator/observer reviews each line of code as it is typed in. Switch roles frequently. 

We create better software if we work in a series of small steps.
Frequent small commits
But don't really want to commit code without review.
Pair programming allows for continuous review.

Programmers don't know everything - but they do know how to look everything up.

Listen carefully to other people's questions.

### Git Tower

Got the Tower license from Derek. Seems really easy to navigate - friendly interface that makes it simple to stage files and then commit them. Lots of space for a detailed commit message. Notes from the intro documentation - 

- when crafting a commit, it's important to only include changes that belong together. Never mix up changes from multiple, different topics in a single commit. Fixing 2 different bugs should produce at least 2 separate commits. 
- When developing a larger feature, every small aspect of it might be worth its own commit.
- Small commits that contain one topic make it easier for members of your team to understand the changes - and to possibly undo them if something went wrong.
- But often you will work on multiple aspects in parallel - can't always guarantee that you make changes for one and only one topic. This is where the staging area comes in - allows you to determine which of your local changes shall be committed. Changes that were added to the staging area will be included in the next commit.
- Write good commit messags. Begin with a short summary of your changes. The body of the message should provide detailed answers to the following questions: what was the motivation for the change? How does it differ from the previous version?
- Never commit something that is half done
- Don't commit code that you "think" is working - test it well before you commit it to the repository
- Commit often - make it a habit

### To-dos

- [x] Divvy
- [x] Add design links to portal
- [] Add to visual inspiration folder
- [x] Work on inline styles
- [] Choose your own adventure
- [x] Go for a long walk


## October 8, 2022

### Standup

Yesterday I explored some additional HTML tags and played around with them in my 4-page website. I understand block and inline display better than I did before - the visuals in the lesson were very helpful. 

This weekend I want to spend some extra time going back over Milestones, working on sprucing up my 4-page site and my portal, and tackling the choose your own adventure exercise. I'm feeling like I'm on top of the lessons, but I haven't had much time to do anything extra. Monday is a holiday here and I have Tuesday off, so I've got four days coming up where I'll have considerably more time to devote to the extra stuff.

I started reading The Design of Everyday Things last night. I saw an instance of very bad design in a Paris hotel - I'll post it today. I was reminded of it when he was talking about doors at the very beginning of the book. 

### Today's lesson - 027: FTP, style like it's 1992

Take a breather. Things are going really well! 

Inline styles
text-transform
background-color
margin
padding

FTP - downloaded Cyberduck, got it set up, added files to the alpha-net.
FTP client opens a connection to the server and gives you an interface to drag your files over to that server. 

Chatted with Derek. He reassured me that the Milestones are nothing to worry about. Look at them if you're interested and/or have time. The pink ones are the only ones that are more immediately actionable. The course should feel bite size. He said everyone in the class is doing really well - the group is notable for its positivity, support and high level of engagement.

Derek has an idea to create a map of books for the course - recommended readings but linked to prerequisite readings, maybe linked to author videos/talks/podcasts. If you're thinking about reading this book, watch this video first. Interactive collections. What books in what order? Might be a good project for me to work on. Would learn about relational databaes. 

### To-dos

- [x] get FTP set up
- [x] put a file up on the alpha-net
- [] work on inline styles 
- [] choose your own adventure

### Standup 

Yesterday I worked on my web portal, which was really fun. It definitely needs some refinement - I want to include the sites that I access every day at the top. And I want it to look nicer! It will be an ongoing work in progress. 

Going through yesterday's lesson, I was struck by a couple of things:
- Get used to leaving your ego out of it and following the requirements as a first priority. This is a great piece of advice.
- I had no idea that "target" can be set to something other than _blank, _self, _parent, or _top. I don't know how often I'll do it, but I like knowing that I can make links open up in the same tab.
- I really want to watch Halt and Catch Fire.

Today, more HTML - I'm pumped to add some styling to my web pages! 

Personal side note - it's the first day of the MLB playoffs and the first time the Mariners have been in the post season since 2001. I am prepared to have my heart broken again, but I am also so hopeful and excited! Go Mariners!

### Today's lesson - 026: More HTML/display types & hierarchy

HTML display types
Block elements stack
Inline elements go in a line and wrap

Default display types can be changed with style attribute

Don't forget that Headings are not about styling - they are about describing the hierarchy of importance

p and h elements should not have lists inside - but lists can include both of those things

### To-dos 

- [x] discover new HTML elements
- [x] break down printed material
- [x] improve project websites


## October 6, 2022

### Standup

Yesterday I practiced using Git to open my daily journal and made sure my repository was still working the way I think it should. I had a little snafu with my course folder - I've been saving everything but pe-projects in a DFTW folder on my desktop, which I thought was actually a Google Drive alias file. In fact, I had a different folder called DFTW on Google Drive, which had different content than the other one. I got the two merged and now I have a Drive alias folder on my desktop for course notes and miscellany. I'm glad I caught it when I did.

I've really enjoyed reading everyone's Substack posts. A huge part of why I wanted to join PE was because I read every Substack post from current and past students that I could get my hands on, and I found them really interesting and inspiring. Now that's us! I'm sure we'll be part of some future student's research and preparation somewhere down the line.

No blockers today. 

### Today's lesson - 025: Research & Web Portals

Get used to leaving your ego out of it and following the requirements as a first priority.

WWW Virtual Library - the oldest catalogue of the web

target can be set to a unique name - 
target="food" would open link in new tab called "food"
I HAD NO IDEA!

*note - I tried this out and found that the name of the tab remained whatever the title of the website is - but it did result in all links with the same target opening in the same tab. This seriously cuts down on the number of open tabs I end up with, so that's really cool!* 

Watch *Halt and Catch Fire* 

Jake recommended Glow for terminal - to view .md files

Alina recommended The Jealous Curator

### To-dos

- [x] research 40 minutes. Find great websites & put them into groups.
- [x] write about your research process for 10 minutes.
- [x] research business card websites. Find 5 examples
- [x] create Google Doc for those - take screenshots of each. Write down what you think the goals of the site are and how successful they are.
- [x] build web portal
- [x] set web portal to be home page

### Questions

Am I doing the right thing by using a User Profile that does not have admin privileges?


## October 5, 2022

### Standup

Yesterday I configured my iTerm, got it to open directly in my pe-projects directory, and also set it up to be able to open files in Sublime Text, which I think is really cool. I also changed some settings in Sublime Text and installed Emmet. 

One thing I'm confused about in Sublime - what is the difference between having "Indent using spaces" selected and not having it selected? If you hit tab either way, the cursor indents whatever number of spaces you have set the tab width at - right? I don't think I see a difference in how the text editor behaves when this setting is selected or unselected, but I am certain I am missing something! 

I'm enjoying the HTML reinforcements and practice. I see that we're heading in a slightly different direction today, but it's all related to the overarching goal of creating a personal business card website. 

A blocker yesterday was looking at the Milestones page and feeling a little overwhelmed. I know that we're not necessarily expected to get through everything on the Milestones page every day, but I want to - I have to accept that it's not always going to be possible, but it is going to be there for me to return to when I have time.

### Today's lesson - 024: Networking

I get a little nervous when it comes to networking. I think it's due to some imposter syndrome. Really putting myself out there and having confidence in this thing that I've barely begun makes me feel uncomfortable. I also haven't told anyone at work that I'm doing this - I need to get on that, pronto. It's real, it's what I want, so I need to own it even though it is a little hard.

### To-dos

- [x] create Substack account
- [x] write an article and publish it (30 minute limit)
- [x] network flow chart in Whimsical

## October 4, 2022

### Standup

Yesterday I learned about some different file types. I hadn't realized that SVG files took up so little space relative to JPEG and PNG files - that's pretty awesome. Also, really neat that the code can be modified so easily after the fact - I'm looking forward to learning how to do that.

I also learned that Macs with M1 and M2 chips restart the PRAM by default when you shut down the computer and turn it back on. 

HTML was a bit of a review for me yesterday, but I had fun doing the exercise - I like HTML.

And I set up a git repository in my pe-projects folder and got my daily journal going.

More HTML today! I'd like to poke around MDN a bit - I've dipped in before, but only for really specific questions and I'd like to get a better overview of the site.

No blockers!

### Questions

- how do I change preferences/settings in Sublime? Specifically, how do I make the tab size stick? (note - I watched Derek's video and figured it out)
- what is the difference between "indent using spaces" and "indent using tab?"

### To-Dos

- [x] review HTML doc structure
- [x] create 4-page website
- [] browsing with a keyboard challenge
- [] check out MDN


## October 3, 2022

Started on HTML today. It's a review for me, but fun to do, fun to be working on a bit of code. 
- h1, h2, p, ul, ol

I watched the video about the problems with VSCode [The Biggest Threat to Innovation of Our Time] (https://youtu.be/mjY5qND8c7U) and wrote this down - "A fair market ensures that innovation takes place." When a giant corporation makes something free, they are not doing it out of a charitable impulse, and they are making sure that they've cornered the market. Of course, we still use Gmail, Google Fonts, and Github. But I thought the point made in the video was a good one, and it definitely makes me think twice about blindly choosing the free option.

File types - the extension tells the parser or the program opening the file which rules to follow
- JPEG, PNG
- SVG
- plain text 
- Rich Text (RTF)
- HTML

UTF-8 - widely accepted, make sure your code works everywhere. 

Looking forward to getting the license for Affinity Designer!

Git seems to be working for me. I'll commit this to a new repository that I've created on my Desktop - I'll have to check in to see if I should be saving this journal somewhere else.
