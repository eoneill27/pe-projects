<h1>Some of Emily's Favorite Things</h1>

<p>On this web page, I will be discussing my favorite place as well as some of my favorite types of food.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Place</h2>

<p>My favorite place is New Brighton Park in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is a short walk from my home - all you have to do is head straight down Wall Street to the overpass - then you can either continue on and enter the park by passing through a short tunnel and then walking by the pool, or you can climb the stairs to the overpass and use the bridge to enter near the dog park. It is a beautiful park with nice walking paths and an amazing view.</p>

<p>3 of my favorite things about New Brighton Park:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The outdoor swimming pool</li>
  <li>The beach, with good logs for sitting and rocks for throwing</li>
  <li>The view of the mountains, the Second Narrows Bridge, the grain terminal, and the water</li>
</ul>


<h2>Types of Food</h2>
  
<p>There are so many different types of food in the world - every country has its own cuisine and its own specialties. It's very difficult to choose a favorite, but I will focus on Japanese and Moroccan food and some of their most-used ingredients.</p>

<h3>JAPANESE</h3>

<ol>
  <li>fish</li>
  <li>rice</li>
  <li>noodles</li>
</ol>

<h3>MOROCCAN</h3>

<ol>
  <li>lamb</li>
  <li>lentils</li>
  <li>vegetables</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, itâ€™s fun to try foods from around the world. It helps you expand your palate and connect with people from different cultures. It would be really wonderful to eat your favorite foods from around the world at your favorite place in your own hometown. Someday soon, I hope to eat delicious salmon oshi or a beautiful chicken tagine at New Brighton Park.</p>
