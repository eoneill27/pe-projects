		<h1>It's nice to meet you!</h1>

		<p>I am an American expat living in Vancouver, British Columbia. I moved here in 2005 to get my degree in Library Science and Archival Studies at the University of British Columbia, and I've been here ever since.<p>

		<p>After 15 years of working as a librarian, I decided I needed a change. This led me to Perpetual Education and their course, Design for the Web. I'm moving through the course with the goal of branching out on my own and making a new career of helping people build beautiful, goal-oriented, user-friendly websites.</p>

		<p>My time in librarianship has given me a good mind for information organization, which I bring to my web design work in the form of simple navigation and clear information structure. I want the information on your website to be easy for you and your customers to find. If this goal seems like a no-brainer, think of all the websites you've encountered where the opposite is true!</p>

		<p>I look forward to hearing from you - I bet we'll work well together!</p>
