		<p>So far, I think it's going really well. For the first three weeks of it, I was on vacation in Morocco. This wasn't always easy. I woke up very early each day and tried to find a quiet place in whatever riad we were at where I wouldn't disturb anyone to do my work. This usually meant creeping around in the dark before the staff was awake, trying to find the best Wi-Fi connection and trying to get as much done before my travel companions got together for breakfast. Sometimes the Wi-Fi was terrible or non-existent, and sometimes we had an early start to our travels so I had to save the work for nighttime. 

		<p>The time difference also made it tricky - Morocco is 8 hours ahead of the West Coast in North America, so I was out of sync with my classmates.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, I felt so fortunate to be able to travel and do the work at the same time! I'm enjoying the course a lot. We're building on our lessons every day and I'm finding it all really interesting and fun. Now that I'm back home, I'll be able to get into a good daily routine of class and work, with fewer distractions and more consistency.</p>
