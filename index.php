					<p class="reading-voice">In my first career, I spent 15 years working as a professional librarian. In my second career, I hope to focus on helping small businesses build beautiful, functional, accessible web sites. Whether you need a site built from scratch or you have an existing site that needs a bit of TLC, I can help you achieve your goals and build your business.</p>

					<p class="reading-voice">I draw on my experience as a librarian and my expertise in my web design work to fine-tune the information architecture supporting your website, making your content easily findable and accessible to all of your users.</p>
